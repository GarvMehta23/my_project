# My Project

This repository contains three demo videos showcasing my Python GUI apps:

- **AI Chatbot** – A natural language chatbot built using NLTK/spaCy.
- **Report Generator** – A tool that creates formatted reports from user input.
- **Weather Dashboard** – A Tkinter-based app that fetches real-time weather data using OpenWeatherMap API.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python (Tkinter, requests, NLTK/spaCy)
- SQLite/MySQL (for data storage)
- API Integration
- GUI Design Principles

## 📽️ Demo Videos
Check out the `.mp4` files in this repo to see the apps in action.

## 🚀 How to Run
These are GUI-based Python apps. To run them:
```bash
python weather_dashboard.py
